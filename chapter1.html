    <p>
      It was Halloween night, the spookiest day of the year. The wind blew restlessly and <span class="fillslot">dauntingly</span> in a <span class="fillslot">quiet</span> neighborhood. All houses were decorated with <span class="fillslot">pumpkins</span> and <span class="fillslot">scary stuff</span> and some families had even put up <span class="fillslot">some festive lights</span> on their front lawns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three friends, <span class="fillslot">Olivia</span>, <span class="fillslot">Sarah</span> and <span class="fillslot">Tim</span>
      had gathered at <span class="fillslot">Olivia's</span> house. The trio had been friends since and it was their yearly
      tradition to spend Halloween night together at one their houses. They'd watch <span class="fillslot">movies</span> and <span class="fillslot">listened some music</span>. Though the main event of the evening, one that everyone was impatiently
      waiting for, was of course <span class="fillslot">The Costumes&nbsp;</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="fillslot">Olivia</span> loved the candy and would probably eat of their loot before they finished their
      round. <span class="fillslot">Sarah</span> and <span class="fillslot">Tim</span> however, were more excited about their
      costumes. Especially <span class="fillslot">Sarah</span> couldn't wait to show off their costume that their had for
      them. So as soon as <span class="fillslot">the movie ended</span> <span class="fillslot">Sarah</span> brought up the costumes...
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="dialog-wrapper">
      <p>
        <span class="fillslot">Sarah</span>: "Shouldn't we get into our costumes? <span class="fillslot">Let's rock the party!</span> <br>
        <span class="fillslot">Olivia</span>: "No way, it's way too early. Aren't we heading out <span class="fillslot">after 11 pm</span>? Besides, my
        <span class="fillslot">stupid</span> costume <span class="fillslot">is too small</span>." <br>
        <span class="fillslot">Tim</span>: "Actually, I should go by my house really quickly and get <span
          class="fillslot">Fifi</span>" <br>
        Olivia: "Wait what, are you bringing your <span class="fillslot">banana</span> trick-or-treating?" <br>
        <span class="fillslot">Tim</span>: "Yep! <span class="fillslot">Fifi</span> is part of my costume! I'll be
        <span class="fillslot">a monkey</span> and <span class="fillslot">Fifi</span> will be <span
          class="fillslot">my snack</span>."
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="fillslot">Olivia</span> and <span class="fillslot">Sarah</span> <span class="fillslot">sighed</span>. Both of them
        doubted whether it would be a good idea to <span class="fillslot">to dress as a monkey and take Fifi with them</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="fillslot">Tim</span>: "Oh come one! It will be awesome! Just give me <span class="fillslot">a minute</span> and I'll go get <span
          class="fillslot">Fifi</span> and we can head out then."
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="fillslot">Tim</span> looked at their friends <span class="fillslot">pleadingly</span>. The other two
        considered the idea. <span class="fillslot">Tim</span> was clearly excited about their idea and the other two did
        not want to <span class="fillslot">spoil his fun</span>. And after all, what could even go wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
          <span class="fillslot">Olivia</span>: "Okay, fine. Go get <span class="fillslot">Fifi</span>. We'll <span class="fillslot">listen some music</span> while we wait for you."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, awesome! Oh we're gonna look so cool! This is going to be the best Halloween yet", <span
          class="fillslot">Tim</span> exclaimed with excitment, jumped off the couch and ran out of the living room. Soon the other two heard <span class="fillslot">something</span>.
