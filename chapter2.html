      <p>
        When <span class="fillslot">C</span> got back with their <span class="fillslot">pet</span>, <span
          class="fillslot">A</span> and <span class="fillslot">B</span> had already <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>. While
        <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> was standing in front of the mirror adjusting their <span
          class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>, <span class="fillslot">A</span> was sitting on the hallway floor wondering
        whether the <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> or whether they should ask their mum
        for
        an extra <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh finally!" <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> sighed when <span class="fillslot">C</span>, dressed as <span
          class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>, opened the front door. "What took you so long?" <span
          class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        "<span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> took longer than I thought", <span class="fillslot">C</span>
        moaned in frustration holding <span class="fillslot">pet</span> dressed as <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>. "How was <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>? Did you <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> while I was gone?" <span class="fillslot">C</span> asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        "<span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>. But <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>! Otherwise we'll get apples or something when people run out of candy", <span
          class="fillslot">A</span> snapped, stood up and straightened their <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> costume.
        "Come on, let's go!"
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> minutes later...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "<span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>. Our neighbors were already almost out of candy!", <span
          class="fillslot">A</span> huffs and shoots an angry look at <span class="fillslot">C</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We could go to <span class="fillslot">name of a street</span>", <span class="fillslot">C</span> proposes. "They
        are quite a few houses there and most kids don't go there."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yeah because <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>!", <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> states worried look on their face.
        They won't admit it to their friends but they are actually a little bit afraid of <span
          class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What's the big deal? You're not afraid of the <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>, are you?", <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> smirks.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Of course I'm not!" <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> scoffs but looks still nervous.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well let's just go then! Let's get that candy!" <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> says sounding <span
          class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>. They start leading the group towards <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>. <span
          class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> hesitates for <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> and then sprints after the
        others.
