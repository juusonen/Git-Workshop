    <div class="story-area">
      <p>
        When <span class="fillslot">Tim</span> got back with their <span class="fillslot">pet banana</span>, <span
          class="fillslot">Olivia</span> and <span class="fillslot">Sarah</span> had already <span class="fillslot">danced on the ceiling</span>. While
        <span class="fillslot">Sarah</span> was standing in front of the mirror adjusting their <span
          class="fillslot">socks</span>, <span class="fillslot">Olivia</span> was sitting on the hallway floor wondering
        whether the <span class="fillslot">rain would ever stop</span> or whether they should ask their mum
        for
        an extra <span class="fillslot">pair of wellies for Fifi the banana</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh finally!" <span class="fillslot">Olivia</span> sighed when <span class="fillslot">Tim</span>, dressed as <span
          class="fillslot">Elvis</span>, opened the front door. "What took you so long?" <span
          class="fillslot">Sarah</span> asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        "<span class="fillslot">The coding workshop</span> took longer than I thought", <span class="fillslot">Tim</span>
        moaned in frustration holding <span class="fillslot">Fifi</span> dressed as <span class="fillslot">a cowgirl</span>. "How was <span class="fillslot">the disco</span>? Did you <span class="fillslot">have a good time</span> while I was gone?" <span class="fillslot">Tim</span> asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        "<span class="fillslot">No, Sarah can't do the lifts like you can</span>. But <span class="fillslot">hurry up, we need to head out now</span>! Otherwise we'll get apples or something when people run out of candy", <span
          class="fillslot">Olivia</span> snapped, stood up and straightened their <span class="fillslot">Jesus</span> costume.
        "Come on, let's go!"
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <span class="fillslot">Forty-five</span> minutes later...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "<span class="fillslot">That was lame</span>. Our neighbors were already almost out of candy!", <span
          class="fillslot">Olivia</span> huffs and shoots an angry look at <span class="fillslot">Tim</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We could go to <span class="fillslot">Elm Street</span>", <span class="fillslot">Tim</span> proposes. "They
        are quite a few houses there and most kids don't go there."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yeah because <span class="fillslot">Old Man McGee lives there</span>!", <span class="fillslot">Sarah</span> states with a worried look on their face.
        They won't admit it to their friends but they are actually a little bit afraid of <span
          class="fillslot">Old Man McGee</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What's the big deal? You're not afraid of a <span class="fillslot">little old man</span>, are you?", <span class="fillslot">Olivia</span> smirks.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Of course I'm not!" <span class="fillslot">Sarah</span> scoffs but looks still nervous.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well let's just go then! Let's get that candy!" <span class="fillslot">Olivia</span> says sounding <span
          class="fillslot">cocky</span>. They start leading the group towards <span class="fillslot">Elm Street</span>. <span
          class="fillslot">Tim</span> hesitates for <span class="fillslot">a moment</span> and then sprints after the
        others.
