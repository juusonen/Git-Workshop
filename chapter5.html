      Kids walked down the stairs in to the darkness and found a zombie monkey. 
      Monkey stared them with it's red and bloody eyes. It's face was melting and it didn't have lips, 
      only bloody mess where it's mouth was supposed to be. But it was chewing and chewing and chewing... 
      The horrible living dead monkey was holdin what's left from sweet Fifi in it's hand and smirked. "It's your turn next", it seemed saying with
      it's empty eyes.
      
      Olivia, Sarah and Tim screemed and run away. "Let's get you a nice pet apple instead", said Sarah and Tim nodded. "Yeah, that banana started to
      get rotten anyways", Tim sighed.
